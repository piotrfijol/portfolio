## Projects [React]

### 1. Countdown Timer

A launch countdown timer app. Here is the [link to the exercise](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-). Since I don't own a premium account I couldn't access the design file so I had to follow the screenshots.

### 2. Landwind landing page

In this project I wrote a code in React for a landing page. The design for the page isn't mine. I found it on [Figma's website](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1125744163617429490) it was made by [this user](https://www.figma.com/@themesberg). To create this project
I used TailwindCSS and some of the Flowbite's components.

## [InvoAcademy](https://platform.invo.academy/) projects [HTML, SCSS, JS]


In every repository where I solve InvoAcademy exercises there is a **Design.fig** [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) file included 
(that InvoAcademy provided me with) that shows the exact design of the page. Additionally I received 
requirements as to how the webpage should behave and feel.
