### 1. Countdown Timer

A launch countdown timer app. Here is the [link to the exercise](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-). Since I don't own a premium account I couldn't access the design file, therefore I had to follow the screenshots.

### 2. Landwind landing page

In this project I wrote a code for a landing page using React, TailwindCSS and some of the Flowbite's components. 
The design for the page was created by [Themesberg](https://www.figma.com/@themesberg), it can be found on [Figma's website](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1125744163617429490).

The designs for projects 1-5 come from [InvoAcademy](https://platform.invo.academy/). In each repository there is a **Design.fig** [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) file included. Additionally I received requirements as to how the webpage should behave and feel.
